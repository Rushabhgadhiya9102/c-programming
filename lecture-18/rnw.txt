Cybersecurity refers to the practices, technologies, and processes designed to protect digital information, systems, and networks from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It involves a combination of people, processes, and technology to safeguard digital assets and prevent cyber threats.

Types of Cybersecurity

Network Security: Protects computer networks from cyber threats by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
Cloud Security: Protects cloud computing environments from cyber threats by implementing security controls, policies, and technologies.
Endpoint Security: Protects endpoint devices such as laptops, desktops, and mobile devices from cyber threats by implementing security controls, policies, and technologies.
Application Security: Protects software applications from cyber threats by implementing security controls, policies, and technologies.
Data Security: Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.
Cybersecurity Threats

Malware: Software designed to harm or exploit a computer system.
Phishing: A type of social engineering attack that involves tricking individuals into revealing sensitive information.
Ransomware: A type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom in exchange for the decryption key.
Denial of Service (DoS): A type of attack that involves overwhelming a computer system with traffic in order to make it unavailable to users.
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): A type of attack that involves intercepting communication between two parties in order to steal sensitive information.
